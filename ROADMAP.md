# PortHub Project Roadmap

Tagline: "The Protocol Registry That Parties Responsibly."

## 📄 Documentation Philosophy

**PortHub maintains minimal documentation by design.** This roadmap serves as
our single source of truth, containing project goals, technical specifications,
and brand guidelines. We avoid documentation sprawl and keep everything
centralized here.

### 📚 README Documentation Standards

- **User-facing README.md**: Essential for NPM and GitHub distribution
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Use for architecture, flow charts, and technical illustrations
- **Diagram rendering**: Mermaid works natively in GitHub/Cursor, but NPM
  requires rendered PNG/SVG versions
- **Documentation updates**: Keep README current with every release - no
  version drift allowed
- **Visual consistency**: All diagrams follow PortHub color scheme and branding
- **Technical depth**: README should be comprehensive enough for developers
  to understand and integrate

## 🎯 Overview

PortHub is a local or network-enabled port registry service for development
environments. It eliminates port conflicts by managing a centralized,
discoverable registry of both static and dynamic port assignments across
projects. Think of it as a DHCP server, but for ports — with a little snark
and a lot of smarts.

### 🌐 DHCP Analogy

| Concept | DHCP Equivalent | PortHub Equivalent |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| IP Address | Port Number | Port Number |
| MAC Address | Client App / Workspace ID | App/Service ID or X-PHub-ID |
| DHCP Discover/Request | Initial broadcast | App pings local PortHub |
| DHCP Offer/Ack | IP assignment | Port assigned & lease granted |
| Lease | Time-based allocation | Port freed if no heartbeat |
| Static Reservation | MAC-IP binding | Reserved port for known app |

⸻

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. 📡 Dynamic Port Leasing

- Behavior modeled after DHCP:
  - App requests a port → PortHub assigns one with TTL
  - App must heartbeat to keep the lease
  - Leases expire and return to the pool if unresponsive
  - Dynamic pool range configurable per workspace

### 2. 🔒 Static Port Reservations

- Developers or systems can register permanent ports for services
- Includes:
  - App name
  - Description
  - Port number(s)
  - Workspace or project association

### 3. 🧠 Port Discovery Mode

- Runs in the background (like fing, nmap, etc.)
- Alerts when an unknown port is bound but unregistered
- Offers options to:
  - Claim (register it)
  - Ignore
  - Block

### 4. 🧰 CLI Tool (porthub-cli)

- Example commands:

```bash
porthub register 8080 --name=tilt-api --desc="Main dev API"
porthub scan --warn-unused
porthub lease --dynamic
porthub dashboard
```

- Returns structured results + emoji-style summaries:
  - 🔒 = static
  - 🔄 = dynamic
  - ⚠️ = conflict
  - 👻 = ghost/unclaimed

### 5. 📟 Daemon Service (porthubd)

- Runs as a background process
- Supports:
  - IPC
  - WebSocket
  - Optional mDNS/ZeroConf for LAN discovery
  - JSON-RPC or custom PHP (PortHub Protocol 😏) with actions:
    - DISCOVER, REQUEST, RENEW, RELEASE, REGISTER, REJECT

### 6. 📊 React-Based Web Dashboard

- Displays:
  - All active services
  - Port ranges & assignments
  - App names and workspace owners
  - Lease countdowns
  - Status (online/offline/conflict)
  - Rotating taglines in header (e.g.,
    - "No Conflicts. Just Connections."
    - "Claim it. Bind it. Own it.")

### **🎯 Target Dev Workflow (The Vision):**

```bash
# User's Perfect Multi-Project Development Setup:

# 1. PortHub daemon runs as local DHCP-style service
porthub start --daemon  # Runs persistently on their Mac

# 2. Each Cursor project auto-registers ports via global cursor rules
# In any project directory:
porthub lease 3000 --project "MyReactApp" --service "dev-server" --ttl 2h
porthub lease 3001 --project "MyReactApp" --service "storybook" --ttl 2h  
porthub lease 5432 --project "MyReactApp" --service "postgres" --ttl 24h

# 3. Real-time monitoring and conflict resolution
porthub status  # Shows all active leases across all projects
# 📊 Active Port Leases:
# 🔌 Port 3000 - MyReactApp/dev-server (expires in 1h 45m)
# 🔌 Port 3001 - MyReactApp/storybook (expires in 1h 45m)  
# 🔌 Port 5432 - MyReactApp/postgres (expires in 23h 45m)
# 🔌 Port 8080 - PortHub/daemon (system reserved)

# 4. Global cursor rules auto-manage leases
# Cursor rules call: porthub heartbeat 3000  # Keeps lease alive
# Cursor rules call: porthub release 3000    # Clean shutdown

# 5. Conflict resolution like real DHCP
porthub lease 3000  # Already taken
# ⚠️  Port 3000 conflicts with MyReactApp/dev-server
# 🎯 Suggesting alternative: Port 3002 available
# 💡 Run: porthub lease 3002 --project "MyOtherApp" --service "dev-server"
```

## 🎨 Style Guide & Brand Guidelines

Port Hub's personality is snarky, sleazy-tech, and self-aware. Think PornHub
meets enterprise service mesh with boundary issues.

### Voice & Tone

- **Snarky** — Like a seasoned dominatrix with a clipboard
- **Sleazy-tech** — 70s adult cinema meets DevOps and DHCP
- **Self-aware** — We know what we're doing. And so do you
- **Deadpan absurd** — Serious infrastructure with tramp stamps

Example Copy:

- "Port 3000 just got railed."
- "Bind it. Spit on it. Make it yours."
- "You registered it raw. You nasty."

### Theme & Layout

**Color Palette:**

- Black background (always)
- Bright orange (#FF9900) primary (PornHub homage)
- Accents: neon pink, ultraviolet purple, slime green

**UI Vibe:**

- Vegas LED porn studio meets 1998 hacking console
- Panels shaped like anatomical references that just skirt policy

### Visual Elements

**Icons/Emoji:**

- 🍆 = open port
- 🍑 = server-side
- 🍒 = active service
- 📞 = TCP bind
- 🧼 = clean exit

**Meme & Shape Mapping:**

- Eggplants for sockets
- Melons for bandwidth
- Squeeze boxes for modular services

### Registration Language

We don't "register" — we:

- "Book a port"
- "Sign the service"
- "Seal the deal"
- "Stake your claim"
- "Slide into the socket"

### Naming Conventions

We categorize ports and services like an adult video library:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Nubiles | New ports registered < 1 week |
| Milfs | Ports in the system > 6 months |
| Gmilfs | Legacy services (e.g., Java RMI) |
| TrampStamps | Ports that appear, disappear, unclaimed |
| BindStormers | Services that cycle ports or multi-bind |
| Fluffers | Helper daemons that do pre-checks for other services |

### Easter Eggs (Triggerable or Rare UI Events)

- Typing 69 into a port field triggers a NSFW beep
- Searching for port 1337 shows a l33t hacker pop-up
- Entering a conflicting port flashes a "No means no!" banner
- Binding to port 420 enables "high availability" mode
- Registering from 127.0.0.1 at 4:20am triggers "local hookup" badge
- Fluffer mode has a 3% chance of moaning during handshake
- If all services crash: a disco ball drops and Barry White plays
- Dark mode flickers on and off randomly on April 1
- A rare "Casting Couch Mode" darkens UI with red velvet trim
- Use of '–raw' CLI flag triggers parental warning
- Typing 'hubba hubba' into terminal opens retro 70s console

### Terminology

- **Hublet** – A registered microservice
- **Fluffer** – A port pre-check service
- **Peep Show** – Dashboard of current open ports
- **Casting Call** – Unclaimed services asking to be registered
- **Backdoor** – Services running on privileged ports
- **Safe Word** – CLI shutdown command
- **Money Shot** – Final handshake confirmation
